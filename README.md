## Advent of Code 2021

My [AoC 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) solutions so far in Scala, Java and Golang done during a COVID-19 infection and quarantine during the Christmas break.
I worked on the problems with a REPL style getting the samples and inputs from the `inputs` directory and printing the result and pasting it to the AoC site.
